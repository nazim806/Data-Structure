# Data-Structure

A data structure is a way of organizing the data so that the data can be used efficiently. Different kinds of data structures are suited to 

different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. Data structure is important to store data, but way of 

storing the data is more important than storing the data.

**Linear data structure:** A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence or a linear list. Examples: Array. Linked List, Stacks and Queues

**Non-Linear data structure:** A data structure is said to be non-linear if traversal of nodes is nonlinear in nature. Example: Graph and Trees.
